# OpenGills
An open source ventilator garage project inspired by these three university projects. Sincerely thank you for their inspirations. They say necessity is the mother of all inventions. Covid-19 pandemic has made these inventions necessary to survive and sustain as us. The goal of this project is to inspire other makers, DIY enthusiasts and kids alike around the world to come up with ideas using off the shelf easily available items. How knows, by the next time a new respiratory pandemic attacks we will be ready with a simple and reliable low-cost ventilator.
