# OpenGills
An open source ventilator garage project inspired by these three university projects. Sincerely thank you for their inspirations. They say necessity is the mother of all inventions. The COVID-19 pandemic has made these inventions necessary to survive and sustain us. The goal of this project is to inspire other makers, DIY enthusiasts and kids alike around the world to come up with ideas using off the shelf items. Should there a time where a respiratory pandemic hits, we will be ready with a simple, reliable, low-cost ventilator in abundance.
