# OpenGills
NOTE: This is not a FDA approved design ventilator, however if you have the capabilities to better this design, you could potentially apply for the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) application with the FDA.
OpenGills is an open source ventilator garage project inspired by these three university projects:
1.	Open Source Ventilator Project https://simulation.health.ufl.edu/technology-development/open-source-ventilator-project/
2.	MIT E-Vent http://e-vent.mit.edu
3.	Rice University ApolloBVM - Emergency Use Ventilator https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t2t8d8xtD0
This morning on CNN, it reads that the world is scrambling to buy ventilators in the Covid-19 pandemic. For example South Sudan has only four ventilators for 12 million people! https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/18/africa/covid-19-ventilator-shortage-intl-scli/index.html. Unfortunately, this is the precarious world we all live in today...
Our project is built upon the concept to provide positive pressure ventilation to patients who are not breathing or not breathing adequately using manual resuscitators also known as an AMBU bag (acronym for Artificial Manual Breathing Unit). The Ambu bag was invented in 1953 by German engineers and it has stood the test of time. AMBU bags are widely used by EMT’s and paramedics. These bags are usually plentiful in hospitals around the world. As they say “Necessity is the mother of invention” – The Covid-19 pandemic has made these inventions necessary to survive, sustain and prevail as a society.
The goal of this project is to inspire other makers and kids alike around the world to come up with innovative, life-saving ideas using off-the-shelf items. Additionally to facilitate this project, we’ve included the code, circuit and materials on github see descriptions below. Should there be a time where a respiratory pandemic hits again, individuals can potentially create a simple, reliable and low-cost ventilator for under $100, which would combat the worldwide shortages we are witnessing on the news.
Our garage ventilator costed us approximately ~$150. Due to quarantine, gathering parts were challenging. Use your imagination to build your own ventilator. Check our Bill of Materials list to see what we used!
We are no medical professionals, but if you wanted to explore more into the most precise requirements for ventilators, a good source to check out is MIT’s model found at the following link: https://e-vent.mit.edu/clinical/key-ventilation-specifications. On their website it states that the volume of air pushed into lung (also called Tidal Volume) should be between 200 – 800 mL based on the patient’s weight. Currently, on OpenGills, “Air volume” and “Respiratory rates” can be controlled but this component is still a work in progress in our project. For accuracy it could be measured through using sensors to record the input and the output volumes of air. Furthermore, for better compression of the AMBU bag one could utilize the 785 Gear Rack Kit (Dual Perpendicular) https://www.servocity.com/785-gear-rack-kit-637171
Now, enough talk, let’s build!
